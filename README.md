* Arc highlight: Degrees (7, 22, 45, 72), Radians  (1, 2, 3, Pi).
* Arc unit markers: Degrees (1, 5, 10).

## Multi Type C
A shape changer. Its options are:
* Choose bulkhead sizes (virtually all standard/stock ones and then some)
* Real Scale (red meshes) toggle.

## Ruler Imperial™
A ruler that measures in factors of 1.25m and has toggle-able lengths up to 10m. Its options are:
* Lengths/Segments of 1.25m up to 10m.

* Lengths/Segments of 1m up to 10m.
* Units: 
  * Eighths (0.125m, 0.25m, 0.5m).
  * Tenths (0.1m, 0.5m).

## Ruler Real Scale
A ruler that measures in steps of 0.1m with clear 1m marks, and indicates KSP size (and real size in red).
* Variant 1: Has fixed length options (1.6m, 3.2m, 4.8m, 6.4m, 8m) and adjustable stack node via B9 Part Switch.
* Variant 2: Stretchy and controlled by the deploy slider. Spans 0.6m ~ 10m.

## Ruler Beam
A tiny ruler, stackable, which measures with 0.01m precision up to 2m and 0.1m precision beyond that. Its beams are emissive and colored with inspiration from color temperature. The beam length options are 1m, 5m, 10m, 50m.
